This paper summarise findings from farmers of 3 different provinces of Afghanistan. The survey sample included 1503 farmers owners/operators. Questionnaires were asked as an structured interview with the farmers.

1 Summary
In conclusion, based on the mean and standard deviation uni-variate anal-
ysis of our continues and discrete variables through sub-sampling we can
conclude that in  rst province which has lower average temperature and
comparatively low average rainfall rate as well. Both factors has a ected
the average livestock income of farmers to be less than the average of the
second and third provinces. Furthermore, in sub-sample analysis in-dept
comparison cross analysis of di erent variables has been done which illus-
trates numerical variables di erences through critical measures of dispersion
analysis.

2 Introduction
This paper summarizes  ndings from farmers of 3 di erent provinces of
Afghanistan. The survey sample included 1503 farmers owners/operators.
Questionnaires were asked as an structured interview with the aforemen-
tioned farmers. Moreover, The survey project was motivated by a number
of questions. And all questions asked respondents to comment on farm char-
acteristics, practices, tools, facilities and personal conditions that latter on
encoded as number of categorical and numerical variables in accumulated
data-set. Hence, categorical variables of our data-set are as follow: Province,
Solar Panel, Access to Internet, Generator Main Occupation Farming and
Literacy. Furthermore, the numerical variables of our data-set is of eight
variables that are Livestock Net Income, Temperature, Rainfall, Mobile, TV
, Motor-Bike, Car and No Hrs with Electricity.

3 Methods
In this paper for analysis of categorical and numerical variables we are go-
ing to use di erent numerical measures such as central tendency, variation,
distribution and also we have used simple frequency table for categorical
data. Since, frequency tables are useful for analyzing categorical data and
for screening data for data entry errors we measured our categorical variables
with them. Subsequently, in order to better communicate our results we have
used visualization tools such as pie-charts for categorical variables as well as
histograms for our continues and discrete numerical variables. Furthermore
in sub-sample analysis we have used measures of dispersion (mean/standard
deviation) in order for assessing our numerical data spread and dispersion in
order for better comparison.
